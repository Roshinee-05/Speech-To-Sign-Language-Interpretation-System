# Speech-to-Sign Language Interpretation System üáÆüá≥

> Bridging the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired using Deep Learning and Indian Sign Language (ISL)

## Overview

This project presents an **AI-powered real-time speech-to-sign language interpretation system** aimed at enhancing inclusive communication for the aurally challenged. The system captures spoken English, transcribes it using **Wav2Vec2.0**, and displays corresponding **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** animations through an intuitive GUI interface.

Developed using a **hybrid MATLAB‚ÄìPython framework**, the system serves as a low-cost, scalable assistive tool suitable for deployment in public spaces, classrooms, or personal use.

## Objective

To design and implement an efficient system that:
- Captures real-time speech using MATLAB
- Transcribes speech to text using **Wav2Vec2.0 (wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-english)**
- Maps transcribed words to ISL video animations
- Provides a seamless, GUI-based user experience

## System Workflow

```text
1. Real-time speech input (MATLAB)
2. Save as .wav (16 kHz, mono)
Ô∏è3. Python script (Wav2Vec2.0 ‚Üí Text)
Ô∏è4. Text preprocessing & word splitting
Ô∏è5. Match each word to ISL animation (.mp4)
6. Display animations via OpenCV GUI
